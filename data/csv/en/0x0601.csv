0x80,Operation status,This property indicates the ON/OFF status of the weighing machine operation,"ON=0x30, OFF=0x31",.,unsigned char,1,-,mandatory,mandatory,mandatory,
0xB0,Display control setting,Sets the status as to whether the displaying of characters is enabled or disabled and acquires the current setting.,Displaying enabled: 0x30 Displaying disabled: 0x31,.,unsigned char,1,-,optional,optional,-,
0xB1,Character string setting acceptance status,This property indicates whether or not the device is ready to accept the character string to present to the user.,Ready: 0x30       Busy: 0x31,.,unsigned char,1,-,-,mandatory,mandatory,
0xB2,Supported character codes,"This property indicates, in a bit map format, the implemented character codes that can be used to present character strings.",Bit 0   ANSI X3.4 Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 1   Shift-JIS Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 2   JIS Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 3   Japanese EUC Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 4   UCS-4 Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 5   UCS-2 Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 6   Latin-1 Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 7    UTF-8 Implemented: 1 Not implemented: 0 Bit 8 and succeeding bits: for future reserved    0,.,unsigned char×2,2,-,-,mandatory,-,
0xB3,Character string to present to the user,"Sets the character string to present to the user, the length of the character string and the character code to use to present the character string and acquires the stored setting. The highest-order byte shall indicate the byte sequence data length of the character string to present to the user and the second-highest-order byte shall indicate the character code to use. The second-highest-order byte shall be followed by a byte containing “0x00” (for future reserved), which shall be followed by a number of bytes, each assigned with one of the first and succeeding bytes, starting with the first byte, of the character string to present to the user. The lowest-order byte shall be assigned with the last byte of the character string to present to the user.",First byte: Byte code sequence data length of the character string to present to the user converted to the hexadecimal format Second byte: Character code to use Third byte: for future reserved Fourth and succeeding bytes: Byte code sequence of the character string to present to the user (max. 244 bytes) Each of the character codes listed below shall be assigned with the indicated code value.
